## Lab 4 Source Code
### Unit Testing the Java Coffee Maker Application

### Objectives

- Write a Test Plan for the Coffee Maker Application (based on the requirements)
- Write JUnit Tests for the Coffee Maker Application

Two versions of the code are provided.  One that has bugs.  One that has been fixed.

A unit testing file has been placed into the directory of the buggy code.

The three unit tests in the CofferMakerTest.java unit testing file currently pass.

The developer needs to implement additional unit tests that identify the bugs in the code.

Then verify that the tests pass in the bug fixed code.
